1)Large team of known developers that i knew personally
or used they products in past. Products that has bean successful and introduced new technologies to cryptoworld. Therefore making it more safe and useful.

2)Fair premine distribution and burning of all unsold coins. Also limiting spend of premine over time that will insure long time work on Hubcoin and other affiliated projects. This as well will
insure value of Hubcoin in long run for investors.  

3)Use of Ethereum network which is now used as a platform for many projects, companies and common users. Ethereum platform is proven to be secure, fast and versatile.

4)Ability to share ideas with like minded people and providing/receiving help for upcoming and existing projects. Therefore enabling us to produce products with latest technologies, security and options for our end user.

5) Initial coin offering (ICO) that will allow us to obtain funds for hardware, advertisement campaigns and other spending allowing us to fully concentrate on the end product.
