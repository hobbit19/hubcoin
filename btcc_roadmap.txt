This is the key Hubcoin idea, inspired by NEM https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=422129.0 (2 biilion capitalization for now).
NEM has proven that experiments with fair coins distribution have great potential.
While NEM distributes premine between all comers, we only give it to other coin developers.
Any developer of altcoins is much more skilled in their improvement and promotion than an ordinary user.
So I strongly believe that a team consisting of dozens of such developers will quickly bring the coin to success.

Hubcoin was launched 11 July as Ethereum token (Erc-20 Based, but with additional code that limit premine spending).
[b]It will be impossible to dump premine early, only smoothly spending during 1 year. [/b]

1. 10% Premine was distributed between all the altcoin developers (who agreed to receive it).
This is the key Hubcoin idea, inspired by NEM https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=422129.0 (1 biilion capitalization for now).
NEM has proven that experiments with fair coins distribution have great potential.
There was many other experiments in premine distribution too, between miners, residents of Iceland (Auroracoin) etc.
[b]We decided to distribute premine between most skilled and useful for coin peoples in the world - another altcoin developers.[/b]

2. Investors usually like startups, coins and projects with strong teams

3. It isnt standart Ethereum token, we have unique technical feature: premine spending is limited by code.
Developers (and me too) would gradually spend it throughout 1 year, so this will provide a long-term motivation for all team and will prevent early dumps.

4. The mission of the Hubcoin is uniting altcoin developers, creating instruments for them, and providing assistance with investments and promotion.
This is also quite unique and useful for the whole community.

5. You could use our altcoin creation, hosting, revivng and promotion services and pay with Hubcoin in the future.
